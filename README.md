## Introduction

`clang-mc` is a **compiler toolchain** designed specifically for **Minecraft datapack development**. It aims to provide a more efficient and maintainable development environment while offering a standard library to reduce redundant implementations of common functionalities.

Minecraft datapack development has long suffered from **poor readability, maintenance challenges, and functional limitations**. For example:
- **Lack of modern programming language features**: String manipulation, floating-point arithmetic, and large integer operations are extremely difficult to implement.
- **Disorganized code structure**: Datapacks often rely on a large number of manually written commands, and many requirements must be indirectly implemented using multiple `.mcfunction` files, making reuse and expansion difficult.

This project seeks to address these issues to some extent.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Basic implementation of the `stdlib` standard library**, establishing a low-overhead virtual machine model on `mcfunction`.
- [x] **Write a wiki** to define calling conventions, register conventions, stack conventions, etc.
- [x] **Implement an assembler (IR)** to translate IR into `mcfunction` code based on `stdlib`.
- [x] **Develop a parser** to convert assembly code into IR objects.
- [x] **Create a showcase** to demonstrate the advantages of this project.
- [x] **(Long-term goal) Implement an LLVM backend** to generate assembly code (IR).
- [ ] **(Long-term goal) Achieve compatibility with C/C++/Rust ecosystems**, leveraging LLVM to extend the capabilities of `mcfunction`.
